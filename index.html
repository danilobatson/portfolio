            <p >Hello!
My name is Danilo Batson, and I am a software engineer. I currently work full-time at a startup called <a href='https://www.mongooseresearch.com/' target="blank">Mongoose Research</a> as a Front-End developer where I work on our platform's integrations and chat platform.
Before working at Mongoose Research, I worked at <a href='https://www.creditkey.com/' target="blank">Credit Key</a> as a React developer. I have current focuses on Mobile App Development as I have completed several mobile applications on React Native and Expo. Prior to starting my coding career, I launched a nonprofit right after the start of COVID-19 called <a href='https://www.spicygreenbook.org' target="blank">Spicy Green Book</a> to help empower Black-owned businesses. In creating and running this nonprofit I quickly learned the various aspects of running a tech startup.

</p>
<p>
Spicy Green Book is a completely volunteer based native mobile ap and web app that helps people discover Black-owned restaurants near them. I worked with various volunteer product/project managers, designers, photographers, marketers, videographers, and programmers all collaborating to help bring a software product to market.

</p>
<p>
We were constantly onboarding new people and quickly integrating them into our workflow. We could always use more programmers so I decided to learn how to code so I could help.

</p>
<p>
I did a lot of self-teaching as well as enrolling myself in a coding camp! I have several certifications from <b> Zero To Mastery, Codecademy, LinkedIn, and freeCodeCamp.org</b>. I have quickly learned that I really enjoy programming and have continued to contribute to Spicy Green Book as well as other various projects.

</p>
<p>
I definitely have a passion for programming and would like to make it into a career. Please consider bringing me into your organization. I learn fast and am looking forward to being a value-added employee as fast as possible!
</p>
